# WebScraper
WorldFactbook Scraper that scrapes information and answers User Query

A program written for my Networks and Social Systems course at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania. We were tasked with scraping information
from a database online. In this case, it was from the CIA World Factbook. We were able to parse through the HTML source code and
pull specific information of interest that we needed to answer specific questions about countries and we also came up with our own
interesting question/query. We also generalized the capability of the program to be able to respond to any input from the user for those
specific questions.
